A old high school project file created while designing mousetrap powered cars.
It was created in Fall of 2016 in Autodesk Inventor and AutoCAD.
The goal was to design the mousetrap cars and cut the shapes out of foam core board
using a laser cutter, then hot glue the pieces together, with a mousetrap on top.
A string with one end tied to the mousetrap was then wrapped around the rear axel of the car,
which would make the car move when the trap was set off.
The car would then be tested against designs from other groups.
